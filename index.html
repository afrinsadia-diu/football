            <p>We had lunch here a few times while on the island visiting family and friends. The servers here are just wonderful and have great memories it seems. We sat on the ocean front patio and enjoyed the view with our delicious wine and lunch. Must try!</p>

            <p>Rachel at the Pool (drinks server) was so gorgeous. We chatted with her all weekend and she played with the kids. She's an asset to the hotel esp for people with families. I saw other attendants playing with the kids too which is so welcoming. Rachel was gorgeous. Give her a raise! </p>

            <h3>Michael</h3>
            <p>The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the special bar drinks, the cucumber/cilantro infused vodka martini and the K&P Aquarium was great (even took photos so we could try to replicate at home). </p>
